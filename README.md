> Monorepo tools

Clark is a toolkit for interacting with [alle-inspired](https://github.com/boennemann/alle) monorepos. This is a productization of practices found in [PouchDB](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb), the [Cisco Spark JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/ciscospark/spark-js-sdk), and other monorepo projects.

## Install

```bash
npm install @ianwremmel/clark
```

## Usage

Unlike [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) or similar tools, `clark` lets you keep track of your dependencies all in your main `package.json` (key benefits being significantly faster `npm install` times and the ability to use greenkeeper). In order to get this benefit, however, you'll need to follow one of two patterns ([alle](#alle) or [non-alle](#non-alle), described below). Once you pick one of those patterns and configure your repository accordingly, you can use `clark hoist`, to move your deps from you individual subpackages to your repo root.

### Alle

[Alle](https://github.com/boennemann/alle) was originally described as just an example of how things _could_ work, before eventually being enacted by [pouchdb](). In order to follow the Alle pattern, all of your package **must** be kept in `./packages/node_modules` and the name of each `package.json` **should** match the subfolder path (yes, this includes the org/user scope if present).

**Benefits**

*   Alle is symlink free. It relies on the behavior of `require()` inside a `node_modules` directory to search both up the tree and in sibling folders, thus letting your packages find each other automatically.

**Caveats**

*   Many tools have hardcoded excludes for `node_modules` and some can't be overridden at all. Perhaps most problematically, GitHub PR will collapse most of your diffs assuming that anything in `node_modules` is vendored. GitHub language stats also get confused.
*   If you already have an established project, moving every folder can be problematic.

### Non-Alle

When npm encounters a package version that's simply a file path (e.g. `"my-package": "file:./packages/my-package"`), it will symlink it into `./node_modules`. By putting all of our local node_modules in the top-level `package.json`, we can expose our local packages to each other without making any other repo changes.

> In addition to moving dependencies to the top-level, if `clark` sees your in a non-alle monorepo, it will automatically add the local `file:` entries to the top-level as well. You may want to run hoist whenever you create a new package.

Simply add your package directories the `include` section of `.clarkrc`.

```json
//.clarkrc
{
    "include": ["frontend/*", "backend/*"]
}
```

**Benefits**

*   No need to move anything in your existing project.
*   Doesn't break GitHub.

**Caveats**

*   Not yet tested in the wild.
*   Likely requires a very recent version of npm. (Though, clark requires node 8 or later, so this may not be an issue).

## `clark deps:generate`

Generate package depencies

```
USAGE
  $ clark deps:generate

OPTIONS
  -p, --packageName=packageName  The package for which to generate dependencies. May be specified more than once
  -s, --silent                   Indicates nothing should be printed to the stdout
  --fail-fast                    Alias of --failFast
  --failFast                     Stop on first failure
  --package=package              alias of --packageName
  --package-name=package-name    alias of --packageName

ALIASES
  $ clark deps:generate
```

_See code: [src/commands/deps/generate.ts](https://github.com/ianwremmel/clark/blob/v5.0.0/src/commands/deps/generate.ts)_

## `clark exec COMMAND`

Execute a command in each package directory. Note: commands with spaces and pipes are supported, but must be wrapped in quotes.

```
USAGE
  $ clark exec COMMAND

OPTIONS
  -p, --packageName=packageName  The package against which to run this command. May be specified more than once.
  -s, --silent                   Indicates nothing should be printed to the stdout
  --fail-fast                    Alias of --failFast
  --failFast                     Fail as soon as a command fails, rather than running all to completion
  --package=package              alias of --packageName
  --package-name=package-name    alias of --packageName
```

_See code: [src/commands/exec.ts](https://github.com/ianwremmel/clark/blob/v5.0.0/src/commands/exec.ts)_

## `clark help [COMMAND]`

display help for clark

```
USAGE
  $ clark help [COMMAND]

ARGUMENTS
  COMMAND  command to show help for

OPTIONS
  --all  see all commands in CLI
```

_See code: [@oclif/plugin-help](https://github.com/oclif/plugin-help/blob/v2.1.3/src/commands/help.ts)_

## `clark hoist`

Migrate dependencies and dev dependencies from a sub package to the root package.json

```
USAGE
  $ clark hoist

OPTIONS
  -p, --packageName=packageName  The package against which to run this command. May be specified more than once.
  -s, --silent                   Indicates nothing should be printed to the stdout
  --fail-fast                    Alias of --failFast

  --failFast                     Fail upon encountering a package that cannot be hoisted, rather than running all to
                                 completion

  --package=package              alias of --packageName

  --package-name=package-name    alias of --packageName

  --risky                        Indicates if clark should attempt to reconcile semver mismatches.
```

_See code: [src/commands/hoist.ts](https://github.com/ianwremmel/clark/blob/v5.0.0/src/commands/hoist.ts)_

## `clark init`

Create a .clarkrc file in your project root

```
USAGE
  $ clark init

OPTIONS
  -f, --force          Overwrite .clarkrc with new config
  -s, --script=script  Identifies a script to add to the config file
```

_See code: [src/commands/init.ts](https://github.com/ianwremmel/clark/blob/v5.0.0/src/commands/init.ts)_

## `clark list`

List all packages

```
USAGE
  $ clark list
```

_See code: [src/commands/list.ts](https://github.com/ianwremmel/clark/blob/v5.0.0/src/commands/list.ts)_

## `clark run SCRIPT`

Runs a script in each package directory. This is different from `exec` in that scripts should be defined in .clarkrc and may be overridden on a per-package basis via npm scripts. npm scripts defined only in subpackage package.jsons can be run this way, but only scripts named in .clarkrc will populate the help output.

```
USAGE
  $ clark run SCRIPT

OPTIONS
  -p, --packageName=packageName  The package against which to run this command. May be specified more than once.
  -s, --silent                   Indicates nothing should be printed to the stdout
  --fail-fast                    Alias of --failFast
  --failFast                     Fail as soon as a command fails, rather than running all to completion
  --package=package              alias of --packageName
  --package-name=package-name    alias of --packageName
```

_See code: [src/commands/run.ts](https://github.com/ianwremmel/clark/blob/v5.0.0/src/commands/run.ts)_
