> Monorepo tools

Clark is a toolkit for interacting with [alle-inspired](https://github.com/boennemann/alle) monorepos. This is a productization of practices found in [PouchDB](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb), the [Cisco Spark JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/ciscospark/spark-js-sdk), and other monorepo projects.

## Install

```bash
npm install @ianwremmel/clark
```

## Usage

The key benefit of clark over [lerna](https://lernajs.io/) and similar tools comes from adhering to the directory layout described in [alle](https://github.com/boennemann/alle). In other words, all of your package **must** be kept in `./packages/node_modules` and the name each each `package.json` **should** match the subfolder path (yes, this includes the org/user scope if present).

### List all commands

```bash
clark --help
```

### List all packages

```bash
clark list
```

### Migrate all packages' dependencies to the root

```bash
clark hoist
```

> Note that `dependencies` and `devDepenencies` are combined because the distinction loses meaning in a monorepo (arguably, they should all be devDependencies, but that's not where `npm install` defaults).

### Migrate a package's dependencies to the root

```bash
clark hoist --package
```

### Run a command in each package directory

```bash
clark exec <command>
```

The following environment variables will be available to your script:

*   `CLARK_ROOT_PATH`: The monorepo's root path.
*   `CLARK_PACKAGE_REL_PATH`: The relative path within the monorepo to the package currently being acted upon.
*   `CLARK_PACKAGE_ABS_PATH`: The absolute path to the package currently being acted upon.
*   `CLARK_PACKAGE_NAME`: The name of the package being acted upon according to its `package.json`

The script will be invoked from within the package's directory.

### Run a command in a single package directory

```bash
clark exec <command> --package <packagename>
```

The script will be invoked from within the package's directory.

### Run npm scripts with default fallbacks

While Clark, obviously, provides its own commands, there's a set of very project specific commands that we simply can't dictate for you. These are commands like `build`, `lint`, and `test` that you want to run each independently against each package.

> In documenation, we refer to "commands", but in `.clarkrc`, we use `scripts` to more closely mirror `package.json`.

Magic can be initialized with something like

```bash
clark init --script test='mocha test/*/spec/**/*.js' --script build='babel -d dist src/**/*.js'
```

#### Package Commands

Package commands are executed sequentially in each package directory. They may be overridden with an entry in the package's package.json.

> Note: these scripts receive the same environment variables as `clark exec` and are executed within each package directory.

For example, your repository might use [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) to run your integration tests

```json
//.clarkrc
{
    "scripts": {
        "package": {
            "test": "mocha 'test/*/spec/**/*.js'"
        }
    }
}
```

but if one of the packages in your monorepo is a React project, you might need to test it with [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)

```json
//my-react-app/package.json
{
    "scripts": {
        "test": "jest 'src/**/*-spec.js'"
    }
}
```
